# eGain-SWE-Take-Home-Assignment

## SETUP
Install the whole zip and open the index.html. Make sure cache is enabled in the developer tools.

## Approach
My approach was to find the one that would be technically challenging, expansive but also managable in a few days. I chose the scenario: missing package, because it seemed doable in the given time frame but also I felt that I had a better understanding of the customer insights and perspectives in this topic than the others. I decided to choose the basic web interface (HTML/CSS/JS) for the prototype because I liked the idea of being able to improve it later on, but I also like the creativity that can be conveyed in this path. 

## Screenshots 

The first thing you see is a welcome text and telling you the chatbot is inside the little bubble. I chose the small bubble for its non-disruptive look and the familiarity of it.

Typing a valid tracking number will give this prompt, and 1 of the 4 decisions shown in the flowchart. Delayed, In transit, Missing from databank, and delivered.

If u choose to try another tracking number, it will prompt again for a tracking number.

As well as ask for another tracking number if given an invalid answer (letters or empty or mixed). 
If something goes entirely wrong and somehow its not in the database or a unforeseen event, then it will prompt you to reach a live agent or call the number.
